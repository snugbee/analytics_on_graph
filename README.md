# Analytics on Graph Database Event
This event is designed to introduce data analysts and data scientists to the process of deriving insights from graph databases. The repository contains datasets and scripts to load data into and work with a graph database sandbox.

## Steps

**1. Get a blank DB**
- You can have it in the sandbox. No installation is needed. It lasts for 3 days (72 hours) with 1 extension possibility for 7 days. Refer to [workshop_setup_guide](https://github.com/snugbee/analytics_on_graph/blob/main/workshop_setup_guide.md) for details.
- Alternatively, you can intall free desktop version and create databases there, for the event and future exploration, without expiration.
